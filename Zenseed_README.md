# 🌱 Zenseed Python Reference Baseboard

Welcome to the Zenseed Baseboard — a fully modular, ethical, and scalable foundation for building web applications that uphold transparency, user ownership, and auditability.

This baseboard is **language-agnostic in principle**, with this version implemented in **Python with FastAPI**. It provides a working reference for developers building applications in line with Zenseed's values and architecture.

---

## ✨ Core Principles

- **User-first**: Software adapts to users, not the other way around.
- **Modular**: Every feature is a plug-in, replaceable via interfaces.
- **Auditable**: No black boxes — everything is open, testable, inspectable.
- **Scalable**: Runs on a Raspberry Pi or hyperscale cloud.
- **Accessible & Localizable**: Built to work for everyone, everywhere.

---

## 🧱 Features

- `/meta`: System metadata and module registry
- `/modules`: Introspect loaded components and versions
- `/i18n`: Language support scaffolding
- `/accessibility`: Endpoint for UI accessibility features
- `modules.yaml`: Defines which pluggable modules are active
- Translation layer for optional backends (Keycloak, Go, Rust, etc.)

---

## 📦 Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the app
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Or with Docker:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

---

## 🧪 Testing the API

Try out:
- `http://localhost:8000/meta`
- `http://localhost:8000/modules`
- `http://localhost:8000/i18n`
- `http://localhost:8000/accessibility`

---

## 🧩 Modular Design

Modules are configured in `modules.yaml`:
```yaml
modules:
  auth:
    implementation: keycloak
    version: "1.0.0"
```

Each module implements an interface — e.g., `auth_interface.py`, `secrets_interface.py` — so you can swap them without rewriting the app.

---

## 🛠 Development Philosophy

> “Zenseed is not a framework, it's a way of building — with ethics, flexibility, and human care at the centre.”

This codebase serves as a **reference**, not a requirement. You can reimplement in Rust, Go, or C — as long as the interfaces and principles remain.

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Contributing

Contributions, audits, and critical reviews are welcome. All modules must pass test suites and declare compatibility via `modules.yaml`.

✅ If your code aligns with Zenseed’s values and standards, it may be eligible for Zenseed Accreditation.
